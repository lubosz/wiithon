*******                            Motivation                         *********
*******************************************************************************

The motives for writing a new tool are simple:

1.) I like to work with the linux command line. And the only WBFS tool I found
    is poor in viewing information and perhaps buggy.
    (I have destroyed the WBFS 2 times)

2.) I want to learn more about WBFS.

*******************************************************************************

- WDF support: WDF is a new format for reducing the size of ISO images stored
  on normal file systems. It knows about holes. (see file 'WDF.txt')
    - Tool 'wwt' may import WDF files directly to a WBFS
      and may export discs from WBFS directly to WDF files.
    - Tool 'wit' works with ISO images. WDF images are used transparently.
    - Tool 'iso2wdf' converts ISO images into WDF files.
    - Tool 'iso2wbfs' converts ISO images into splitted WBFS files.
    - Tool 'wdf2iso' converts WDF files into ISO images.
    - Tool 'wdf-cat' is a 'cat' like programm with special handling of WDF.
    - Tool 'wdf-dump' dumps the data structure of a WDF file.

- Support WBFS on block devices, as plain files and as splitted files.
  (plain files are nice for testing)

- Find WBFS partitions on block devices automatically if option --auto is set.

- Multi WBFS support:
    - List multiple WBFS together.
    - Copies ISO images to multiple WBFS with one command.
    - Remove ISO images from multiple WBFS with one command.
    - Searches multiple WBFS for extracting discs.

- Advanced shell support:
    - Exit codes are explained by the tool itself.
    - Output controlling with --quiet and --verbose.
    - Several listings, some of them machine readable.
    - May read parameters from files.

- When writing an ISO you have the choice between three formats:
    - Plain ISO file (default extension ".iso")
    - WDF ISO file (default extension ".wdf")
    - WBFS file as container for one ISO file (default extension ".wbfs").

- When reading an ISO the following files are accepted:
    - Plain ISO files.
    - Plain ISO files from a pipe.
    - WDF ISO files.
    - WBFS files with or without a selector. A selector is an ID6 or an index
      to specify exact one ISO image within a WBFS.

- Support of splitted files (WBFS, WDF and ISO):
    - While generating a file use --split and --split-size to force splitting.
    - While opening files for reading splitted files are detected automatically.

- Dump the data structure of WBFS images for analysis. This dumps includes the
  WBFS header, WBFS main parameters, a disc dump and memory layout dumps for
  each disc and for the whole WBFS.

- Dump the data structure of ISO images for analysis. This dumps includes the
  WBFS header, WBFS main parameters, a disc dump and memory layout dumps for
  each disc and for the whole WBFS. The dump work also for ISO images within
  a WBFS.

- The wwt command CHECK checks a WBFS for block assigning errors. Repairing
  is also possible. Details:
    - Find discs with invalid blocks.
    - Find discs with no valid blocks.
    - Find discs which uses same blocks.
    - Find free blocks that marked as used.
    - Find used blocks that marked as free.
    - Remove discs with errors.
    - Repair wrong marked blocks.
  The check is very fast. The wwt commands ADD, UPDATE, EXTRACT, REMOVE and
  TRUNCATE do an automatic check before modifying the WBFS file and print
  a warning if the check fails.

*******                           WDF support                           *******
*******************************************************************************

I have already implemented the WDF support in my tool 'WWT' and tested it with
many games. In the tests I have converted games from ISO to WDF and back.
I done this with the tools iso2wdf and wdf2iso/wdf-cat and with WBFS import
and export. It work well and have not found any errors.

The advantages are:

 - WDF files are much shorter than ISO images.

 - WDF files needs less disk space than the sparsed ISO images.

 - WDF files can be access by random access. So WBFS manager can extend their
   code to read from and write to a WDF on the fly. WWT does this.

 - WDF is not a compression and works much faster than usal compressors.

For a full WDF description see the file 'WDF.txt' or try the link:
  @@URI-VIEWVC@@/WDF.txt?view=co

Statistic about WDF can be found here:
  @@URI-VIEWVC@@/STATISTICS.txt?view=co

I have written 4 small tools for handling WDF:
 - Tool 'wdf-dump' dumps the data structure of a WDF file.
 - Tool 'iso2wdf' converts ISO images into WDF files.
 - Tool 'wdf2iso' converts WDF files into ISO images.
 - Tool 'wdf-cat' is a 'cat' like programm with special handling of WDF.

I have tested the 3 tools 'iso2wdf', 'wdf2iso' and 'wdf-cat' with more than
2 million files (mixed files including pictures and documents, but only 50 Wii
ISO images) without any errors. This means that the 3 tools are stable and the
usage is sure. For more details call the script './scripts/test-wdf-tools.sh'
from the distribution without parameters.

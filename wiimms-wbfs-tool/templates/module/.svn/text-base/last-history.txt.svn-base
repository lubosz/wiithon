 - New comamnd: wwt PHANTOM: add a phantom discs (fast, for tests only).
 - libwbfs: I have implemented a little ID6 cache for faster disc access and
   less IO when searching discs.
 - CYGWIN bug fix: Using mixed reading and writing on files opened with open()
   fails and write sometimes to wrong file positions (reproducible).
   Switching to fopen() based IO works fine.
 - Docu of wwt+wit RENAME+SETTITLE.

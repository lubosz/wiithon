wwt v0.28a r596 - 2010-01-15

 - Little optimation for libwbfs add_disc(): Read only needed wii sectors from
   iso and fill others with zeros. This makes adding faster and avoids reading
   behind end of file. This is needed for reading from a pipe.
 - New error code: JOB_IGNORED: Set if a disc is ignored while adding a game.
 - wwt ADD: adding to more than one WBFS failed since v0.27a.
 - wit COPY+SCRUB+MOVE: Process files in alphabetic order and print iteration
   counter.
 - Bug fix: wwt LIST: Not all discs were shown if an invalid disc was found.
 - Decompose unusual unicode characters (remove accents...) in title database.

 - wwt ADD: Adding a complete WBFS is optimized and much faster now.
 - Bug fix: Option --preserve didn't work.
 - wwt+wit FILETYPE: Print reagion info if option --long is set twice.

wwt v0.26a r569 - 2010-01-05

 - cygwin: stdout and stderr use windows line ending (CR+LF).
 - Allow german umlaut in destination file names.
 - Bug fix: Option --include-path was only proccessed if also option
   --exclude-path was set.
 - The local title files contain now all titles and not only the local
   modifications. This is good for cygwin which do not support automatic
   language detection. Just rename 'titles-XY.txt' to 'titles.txt'.

wwt v@.@@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Bug fix: Problems while creating a directory path.
 - Option --no-utf-8 did not work, all titles were trash.
 - Option --no-utf-8 is now the default for cygwin. This is needed to allow
   german umlauts in filebnames.
 - wwt ADD: Add files in alphabetic order and print iteration counter.

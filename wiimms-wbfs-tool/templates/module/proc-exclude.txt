*******************************************************************************

The user may define an ID exclusion lists. Each element represents an ID4 or
an ID6. Discs with an ID on that lists are not added, extracted, removed or
listed. The list is controlled by the to options --exclude and --exclude-path,
both can be usd multiple times:

 -x --exclude id     Exclude discs with given ID4 or ID6 from operation.
 -x --exclude @file  Read exclude list from file.

 -X --exclude-path file_or_dir
                     ISO file or base of directory tree -> scan their ID6

The parameters of --exclude are scanned for ID6. Th section "Processing ID6
parameters" describes this scanning in detail.

The parameter of --exclude-path is a filename or a directory name. The given
file or eachfile of the directory tree (recurse, max depth=15) are scanned.
Subdirectories beginning with a dot ('.') are ignored. If a file exists and
is an ISO file the ID6 is extracted and inserted into the exclude data base.

Example:

 You want to make a backup from all new discs of 2 USB drives. The new
 backups should be stored info the sub directory 'new-backup'. The existing
 backups are stored in 'old-backup'. The file names of the old backups does
 not matter:

 # wwt extract -aA --dest new-backup --exclude-path old-backup

The command 'EXCLUDE' builts the exclude data base and prints the result to
stdout.

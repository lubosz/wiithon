The option --sort defines the sort mode for output lists.

  Syntax: --sort sort_mode | -S sort_mode

'sort_mode' is a comma separated list of the following keywords:

    - | NONE    : Do not sort

        ID      : Sort by id
    T | TITLE   : Sort by title taken from title db
    N | NAME    : Sort by name of disc
    F | FILE    : Sort by file name
        SIZE    : Sort by size
    D | DATE    : Sort by date
        TIME    :   " (same as DATE)
    R | REGION  : Sort by region
        WBFS    : Sort by wbfs file name
        NPART   : Sort by number of partitions
        DEFAULT : Use the default sort method for that output

    ASCENDING   : Sort in ascending order.
    DESCENDING  : Sort in descending order (reverse).
    REVERSE     : Alternative keyword for 'DESCEND'.

The latest keyword supersedes the previous one of the same group.
'NONE' resets all. Abbreviations are allowed as long as they are unique.

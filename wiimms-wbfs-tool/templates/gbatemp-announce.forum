[size="3"][color="#800000"][b]A command line WBFS tool set for various os.[/b][/color][/size]

I like to work with the linux command line. And the only WBFS tool I found is poor in viewing information and perhaps buggy (I have destroyed the WBFS 2 times). And because of that I have written a new command line tool for linux.

[color="#0000c0"][b]Some special features:[/b][/color]
[list]

[*] [url="http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=183541#entry2303275"][color=#000080][b]WDF[/b][/color][/url] support: [url="http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=183541#entry2303275"][color=#000080][b]WDF[/b][/color][/url] is a new format for reducing the size of ISO images stored on normal file systems. It knows about holes. (see file '[url=@@URI-VIEWVC@@/WDF.txt?view=co]WDF.txt[/url]')
[list]
    [*] Tool 'wwt' may import WDF files directly to a WBFS and may export discs from WBFS directly to WDF files.
    [*] Tool 'wit' works with ISO images. WDF images are used transparently.
    [*] Tool 'iso2wdf' converts ISO images into WDF files.
    [*] Tool 'iso2wbfs' converts ISO images into splitted WBFS files.
    [*] Tool 'wdf2iso' converts WDF files into ISO images.
    [*] Tool 'wdf-cat' is a 'cat' like programm with special handling of WDF.
    [*] Tool 'wdf-dump' dumps the data structure of a WDF file.
[/list]

[*] Support WBFS on block devices, as plain files and as splitted files.

[*] Find WBFS partitions on block devices automatically if option --auto is set.

[*] Multi WBFS support:
[list]
    [*] List multiple WBFS together.
    [*] Copies ISO images to multiple WBFS with one command.
    [*] Remove ISO images from multiple WBFS with one command.
    [*] Searches multiple WBFS for extracting discs.
[/list]

[*] Advanced shell support:
[list]
    [*] Exit codes are explained by the tool itself.
    [*] Output controlling with --quiet and --verbose.
    [*] Several listings, some of them machine readable.
    [*] May read parameters from files.
[/list]

[*] When writing an ISO you have the choice between three formats:
[list]
    [*] Plain ISO file (default extension ".iso")
    [*] WDF ISO file (default extension ".wdf")
    [*] WBFS file as container for one ISO file (default extension ".wbfs").
[/list]

[*] When reading an ISO the following files are accepted:
[list]
    [*] Plain ISO files.
    [*] Plain ISO files from a pipe.
    [*] WDF ISO files.
    [*] WBFS files with or without a selector.  A selector is an ID6 or an index to specify exact one ISO image within a WBFS.
[/list]

[*] Support of splitted files (WBFS, WDF and ISO):
[list]
    [*] While generating a file use --split and --split-size to force splitting.
    [*] While opening files for reading splitted files are detected automatically.
[/list]

[*] Dump the data structure of WBFS images for analysis. This dumps includes the WBFS header, WBFS main parameters, a disc dump and memory layout dumps for each disc and for the whole WBFS.

[*] Dump the data structure of ISO images for analysis. This dumps includes the WBFS header, WBFS main parameters, a disc dump and memory layout dumps for each disc and for the whole WBFS. The dump work also for ISO images within a WBFS.

[*] The wwt command CHECK checks a WBFS for block assigning errors. Repairing is also possible. Details:
[list]
    [*] Find discs with invalid blocks.
    [*] Find discs with no valid blocks.
    [*] Find discs which uses same blocks.
    [*] Find free blocks that marked as used.
    [*] Find used blocks that marked as free.
    [*] Remove discs with errors.
    [*] Repair wrong marked blocks.
[/list]
The check is very fast. The wwt commands ADD, UPDATE, EXTRACT, REMOVE and TRUNCATE do an automatic check before modifying the WBFS file and print a warning if the check fails.
